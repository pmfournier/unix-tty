This package contains scripts to run Unix V7 on the simh pdp11 emulator, with support for several serial ports

To get started, use the disk in uv7swre.zip, as obtained from http://simh.trailing-edge.com/software.html


FIRST BOOT AND SETUP OF THE DISK IMAGE

pdp11 uv7.simh
@boot
New Boot, known devices are hp ht rk rl rp tm vt 
: rl(0,0)rl2unix
mem = 177856
# cat /etc/passwd
root:VwL97VCAx1Qhs:0:1::/:
daemon:x:1:1::/:
sys::2:2::/usr/sys:
bin::3:3::/bin:
uucp::4:4::/usr/lib/uucp:/usr/lib/uucico
dmr::7:3::/usr/dmr:
# mkdir /usr/dmr
# chown dmr /usr/dmr
# chgrp 3 /usr/dmr
# mkdir /tmp
# chmod 777 /tmp
# ^D


SETUP OF THE TERMINALS

/etc/mknod /dev/tty3 c 0 3
/etc/mknod /dev/tty4 c 0 4
...
 
# Update /etc/ttys
# First character is enabledness (0 or 1)
# Second character is baud rate type (0 is fine)
# Rest is file name after "/dev/"
echo "10tty1" >>/dev/ttys


NORMAL BOOT

Once the image has been setup, just boot it using the automatic script.

  ./start

then telnet to the serial port:

  telnet localhost 8000

or connect to real serial port

  nc localhost 8000 >/dev/ttyS0 </dev/ttyS0
